Credit scoring is a process used by lenders to evaluate the creditworthiness of a borrower. It involves assigning a numerical value, known as a credit score, to an individual based on various factors such as their credit history, financial behavior, and other relevant information. The credit score is used by financial institutions to assess the risk of lending money to a particular individual, with higher scores generally indicating lower credit risk.

Segmentation, in the context of credit scoring, refers to categorizing individuals into different groups or segments based on their credit scores. This segmentation allows lenders to better understand and manage the risk associated with different groups of borrowers. In the provided code, the segmentation is done using the K-means clustering algorithm on the credit scores. The algorithm groups customers into clusters (segments) based on their credit scores, with similar scores belonging to the same cluster.
